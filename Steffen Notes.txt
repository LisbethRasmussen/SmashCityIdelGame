Fix the tank scipts so only ONE is needed. What needs to be done:
- Figure out how to "flip" a object (so the tanks can face left and right with the SAME object)
- In the code define if either the tank is facing the right or left side (If statements!)

Bug with grenades!
- Red dot doesn't despawn the right way

Right side of scene position variable missing!
- So far do we just say something like: "position = 800;" it should be made to a variable

Bug with the people when running!
- Some people disappear because their "random index" was chosen, need to have an if statement there checks if that random index already is spawned or not
